# TrustShield Protocol (Public Preview)

## Vision
TrustShield provides real-time **crypto asset ratings** (A+ … D) combined with **built-in hedging strategies**.  
This empowers investors to manage risk with the same clarity as traditional credit ratings (e.g., Moody’s, S&P).

## Key Features
- Transparent risk scoring (0–100) → converted into ratings (A+, A, A-, … D).
- On-chain **hedging integration** (stablecoins, options, futures, insurance).
- Investor dashboard for token selection, grading, and risk management.

## Why TrustShield?
Current DeFi lacks standardized **risk ratings**. TrustShield fills this gap with an oracle-driven rating system, directly connected to **hedging execution**.
